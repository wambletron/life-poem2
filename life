Days are happy now in the sun
warm to sit in grass and think
watch a baby walk through light

It seems alright when the sun is hot
The earth is green and the fire's on
Please come near while the world still spins
Sit and on the bench

So let the happy times warm your face
Cuddle up to yours
have a drink with fire light 
and beaches crashing out beside

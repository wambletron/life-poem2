hello,
today is starting
sun is staring 
moon is sleeping
roosters are crowing 
cars are zooming
clocks are ticking 
toasters are popping

Days are happy now in the sun
warm to sit in grass and think
watch a baby walk through light

It seems alright when the sun is hot
The earth is green and the fire's on
Please come near while the world still spins
Sit and on the bench

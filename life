hello,
today is starting
sun is staring 
moon is sleeping
roosters are crowing 
cars are zooming
clocks are ticking 
toasters are popping

Days are happy now in the sun
warm to sit in grass and think
watch a baby walk through light

So let the happy times warm your face
Cuddle up to yours
have a drink with fire light 
and beaches crashing out beside
